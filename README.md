## **How our products work**
### **Creator Tool**
The Creator Tool stands as a testament to Qubit's commitment to innovation and uniqueness. Players have the freedom to craft unique objects based on the rarity of their Voxel NFTs, ensuring that each creation is a reflection of their creativity and strategic thinking. Our internal checks guarantee the originality of each design, making every creation a valuable addition to the Qubit universe.

### **Qubit Game**
In the Qubit Game, players engage in a skill-based MMO (Massively Multiplayer Online) environment offering both PvP (Player vs Player) and PvE (Player vs Enemy) modes. Spells and equipment in the form of NFTs are core features, providing strategic depth to gameplay. Playerâ€™s customly built Creation NFTs from the Creator Tool have unique utilities and/or gameplay aspects in the Qubit Game. Dynamic battle arenas and competitive showdowns ensure thrilling experiences with potential high stakes, while PvE encounters offer rewarding challenges with co-op possibilities. NFT rewards, community integration, customizable/upgradable NFTs and innovative gameplay mechanics set Qubit apart in the blockchain gaming landscape.
